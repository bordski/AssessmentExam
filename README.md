Description: The Application is purely made of XCode and uses native frameworks (No Third Party Frameworks used)
             the application gives a brief example of fetching xml files from the web and then parsing it by using NSXMLParser,
			 also the program gives a short code for using mapkit and placing pin annotations via latitude and longitude
thoughts: I do admit that some parts of the code can still be improved and there's a lot of room for refactoring and there are some hardcoded values inside
          but... this is due because of the static and controlled source file
